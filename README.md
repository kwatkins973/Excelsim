Monte-Carlo simulation of queuing network in Excel

This Excel spreadsheet implements a Monte-Carlo simulation of a queuing network consisting of open and/or closed customer classes a network of queues. The characteristics of the queues, classes and routing matrices are defined in sheets and a VBA simulation engine runs the simulation for the defined period.

A rich collection of probability distribution functions are avaialble to sample sojurn time and delays from.

This is still a work in progress and additional validation is required as well as the implementation of some more features such as transient detection, the changing of customer classes and additional queue behaviours.
